# discord-stocks-bot
A discord bot which can be added to a server and used by members to get current stock prices. 
An additional feature is that you can also get a list of the top 10 gaining stocks and top 10 losing stocks of the day. 
I used the Beautiful Soup library in Python to scrape data from Yahoo Finance.
